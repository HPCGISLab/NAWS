1. Copy files into a directory such as ~/workflow/bin

2. Change file modes to be executable

chmod 755 ~/workflow/bin/*.py
chmod 755 ~/workflow/bin/*.sh

3. Modify system-level configuration files
   - Open runexperiment.sh and modify parameters based on system configuration 
   - Open submit-tasklists.sh and modify submission script to match batch job management system
   - Open runabm and configure memory requirements if executing a particularly complex NetLogo model

4. Enter into a directory with a NetLogo model with defined experiment

5. Execute the NAWS using ~/workflow/bin/run/runexperiment.sh <Netlogo model name> <Experiment name>
   A new directory containing all of the parameter files and sub-experiment information will be created along with multiple table files containing the results of each sub-experiment
